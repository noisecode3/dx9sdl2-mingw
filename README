This is a generic template for cross platform SDL2 game development
with MinGW-w64. There is a trivial cube calculation I found on YouTube
for SDL2 and a cube in directx9/SDL2 on MinGW Linux.

-- SETUP --

Build/install MinGW64 11.0.0
on Arch, Slackware, Ubuntu or whatever

This is the versions I used on Slackware 
# Core tools:
BINUTILS=2.39
GCC=13.1.0
MINGW=v11.0.0

# Support tools:
GMP=6.3.0
MPFR=4.2.1
MPC=1.3.1
OSL=0.9.7
ISL=0.26
CLOOG=0.21.1

Now install SDL2 into you're MinGW folder.
On Arch it's right in '/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32' and mixed in '/usr/bin'.
On Slackware its all in '/usr/mingw-w64-v11.0.0_gcc13.1.0/x86_64-w64-mingw32'
and you have '/usr/mingw-w64-v11.0.0_gcc13.1.0/bin'.

Download this file SDL2-devel-2.30.2-mingw.tar.gz from github.
Login to root or write a script or pkg or whatever to unpack this tar.
In the 'Makefile' change the CROSS_PATH, DO NOT end it with a '/' it will fail
and you get an incomplete install of SDL2.

CROSS_PATH := /usr/mingw-w64-v11.0.0_gcc13.1.0

Now run 'make cross'

ln -s /usr/mingw-w64-v11.0.0_gcc13.1.0/x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin/SDL2.dll SDL2.dll

Using a link like this is the most simple solution and you will need to distribute
that SDL2.dll with the exe when its installed.

And now you have a PE32+ executable (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows
